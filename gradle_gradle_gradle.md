## To the tune of [Dreidel](https://youtu.be/HZZO0g5FO4k)

Well
<br>
I work with android gradle
<br>
It often ruins my day
<br>
And when it fails to function
<br>
It fills me with dismay.


(chorus)
<br>
Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle
<br>
It often seems to break
<br>
And when it's finally working
<br>
Its clear android's a mistake


its so hard to understand
<br>
yes I almost just gave in
<br>
Though often sold as groovy
<br>
I think ill go back to maven


(chorus)
<br>
Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle
<br>
It often seems to break
<br>
And when it's finally working
<br>
Its clear android's a mistake



My gradle is so painful
<br>
yes my scripts are spaghetti
<br>
When gradle's finally happy
<br>
Lets throw some confetti



(chorus)
<br>
Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle
<br>
It often seems to break
<br>
And when it's finally working
<br>
Its clear android's a mistake
