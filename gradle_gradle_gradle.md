##To the tune of [Dreidel](https://youtu.be/HZZO0g5FO4k)

Well

I work with android gradle

It often ruins my day

And when it fails to function

It fills me with dismay.


(chorus)

Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle

It often seems to break

And when it's finally working

Its clear android's a mistake


its so hard to understand

yes I almost just gave in

Though often sold as groovy

I think ill go back to maven


(chorus)

Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle

It often seems to break

And when it's finally working

Its clear android's a mistake



My gradle is so painful

yes my scripts are spaghetti

When gradle's finally happy

Lets throw some confetti



(chorus)

Oh, gradle, gradle, gradle

It often seems to break

And when it's finally working

Its clear android's a mistake
